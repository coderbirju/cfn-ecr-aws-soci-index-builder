Lambda logs for generating SOCI index artifacts can be found in the CloudWatch log group `/aws/lambda/<StackName>-SociIndexGeneratorLambda-<hash>`. Lambda logs for repository image tag filtering and matches can be found in the CloudWatch log group `/aws/lambda/<StackName>-ECRImageActionEventFilteringLambda-<hash>`, where `<StackName>` is the name of the stack that you entered in the *Deployment steps* section.

If Lambda logs for generating SOCI index artifacts show that the Lambda function is timing out (that is, **Task timed out** is in the log), this is likely caused by the image size. {partner-product-short-name} supports a maximum compressed image size of 6 GB because larger sizes may force the SOCI index generator Lambda to time out after 15 minutes.

NOTE: A SOCI index will not be generated for an image if every layer in the image is under 10 MiB. For container images greater than 250 MiB (compressed), we recommend lazy loading. You are less likely to see a time reduction for smaller images.
