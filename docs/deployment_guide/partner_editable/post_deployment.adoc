== Cleanup

1. To remove this solution, delete the Amazon CloudFormation stack created in the *Deployment steps* section.
2. In the Amazon CloudWatch Logs console, delete the log groups `/aws/lambda/<StackName>-SociIndexGeneratorLambda-<hash>` and `/aws/lambda/<StackName>-ECRImageActionEventFilteringLambda-<hash>` where `<StackName>` is the name of the stack that you entered in the *Deployment steps* section. You can also use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteLogGroup.html[DeleteLogGroup^] API to delete the log groups.
3. In the Amazon ECR console, delete the SOCI index artifacts. You can also use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_BatchDeleteImage.html[BatchDeleteImage^] API to delete the artifacts.
